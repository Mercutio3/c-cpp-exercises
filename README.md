# Overview
Welcome! :)

This repository consists of my solutions to a series of problems I used to become familiar with the C and C++ programming languages. These problems were handed to me on a weekly basis for 14 weeks, hence the division by "Weeks". Weeks 1-8 cover the C language, while weeks 9-14 cover C++. Within each programming language, the exercies and their solutions get more complex as the weeks go on. However, all the concepts demonstrated remain into the "beginner" levels of C and C++ programming.

## Future Plans
I am now much more experienced and familiar with the two langauges than when I solved these exercises. While commiting my code to this repository, I had the opportunity to look back at my code; I was able to find numerous things I would like to change.

None of these changes would alter the core functionality of my solution programs. Instead, most of them have to do mostly with having cleaner code. I intend to set aside the time one day to clean up my code and add better comments and descriptions to make this repository a better learning & review tool for myself and others.
